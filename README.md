RGH3 Xbox 360 PCB

Made a few pcb designs in eagle for the rgh3 mod for the 360 kind of janky never used the program before....

***Will update this with the resistors/diode info also recommend getting setting the pcb thickness to 0.5mm or so. 

Some files may not upload properly if you try and get some made.
